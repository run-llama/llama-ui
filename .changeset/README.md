# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in [our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to use changesets in this project

### Creating a changeset

When you make changes to the `@llamaindex/ui` package that should be released, create a changeset:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will:
1. Ask which packages have changed (select `@llamaindex/ui`)
2. Ask what type of change this is (major/minor/patch)
3. Ask you to write a summary of the changes

### Release process

The release process is automated via GitHub Actions:

1. **Pull Request**: When you create a PR with changesets, the CI will check that changesets are present
2. **Merge to main**: When changesets are merged to main, a "Version Packages" PR is automatically created
3. **Release**: When you merge the "Version Packages" PR, the package is automatically published to npm

### Manual release (if needed)

```bash
# Build the packages
pnpm build:all

# Update versions and generate changelogs
pnpm version-packages

# Publish to npm
pnpm release
```

### Important notes

- Only the `@llamaindex/ui` package is published to npm
- Example packages and testing packages are ignored in the changeset config
- The package is published as public to the `@llamaindex` organization on npm
